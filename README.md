# Weird Calendar – A Fun & Unusual Daily Challenge Calendar

## Project Overview: 

Weird Calendar is a quirky and entertaining calendar that assigns bizarre, unexpected, or fun tasks to each day. Users can explore daily challenges ranging from small creative activities to silly dares. The goal is to bring a little fun, randomness, and surprise into everyday life.

## Key Features:
Offline Mode: Users can access preloaded challenges even without an internet connection.
Dark Mode & Custom Themes: Personalize the calendar’s appearance with different themes and a dark mode option.
### Daily Strange Assignment: 

Every day comes with an automatically or randomly selected strange activity. For instance, "Be a pirate talker for one hour," "Use chopsticks in eating meal," or "Write a haiku about socks." User Preference: Users are able to set up their odd tasks or retrieve another. Completion Share: Allows users to share the completion with friends or share it on their social media network. Streak Count: Determines how many consecutively user completes weird days. Themes & Categories: Different types of weirdness available for users (for example, funny, creative, adventurous). Reminders & Notifications: Users get daily reminders to check the calendar for a new weird task. Tech Stack: Front-end: React.js (or Next.js) to be used in dynamic and interactive UI. Back-end: Node.js with Express.js to store and serve tasks. Database: MongoDB or Firebase, to store user preferences, streaks, and custom tasks. API Integration: AI is also used for dynamic generation of weird tasks. Hosting & Deployment: Vercel (Frontend) & Render/Heroku (Backend).


## Why This Project? 

Weird Calendar is weird, fun, and makes you do things outside your routine. It's all about randomness, gamification, and creativity integrated into a daily experience.

Work on this, and I would enhance my full-stack development, UI/UX design, database management, and API integration capabilities while creating something unique and fun.
